 My name is Ankit Chandawala and I am currently working as a Software Engineer for [1mg](http://www.1mg.com). I have a degree in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi but my love for programming got me where I am today. I currently code in python but I have messed around with Java as well back from the days when I used to work on Android Platform. 

In my free time, I love travelling, hiking and reading.
